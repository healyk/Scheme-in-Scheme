# Scheme In Scheme
Scheme interpreter written in Scheme.

Read about it [here](http://codingninja.wordpress.com/category/programming/scheme/scheme-in-scheme/)

Note that this is Chicken Scheme specific.  If you want to use/run this in 
another scheme implementation replace the (use ...) statements in repl.scm 
with an appropriate loading mechanism for the SRFIs.
